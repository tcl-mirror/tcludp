	* win/makefile.vc: Improved the win build system.
	* demos/*: Added a few sample applications, demos of broadcast, 
	multicast and normal operation.
	* tools/mpexpand.tcl: Added app for generating documentation.

	* generic/udp_tcl.h: Done some testing with multicast and have
	* generic/udp_tcl.c: rationalised the fconfigure/udp_conf interfaces
	a bit better. The -ttl option will set the multicast ttl if the
	socket has been added to a multicast group. 
	Now maintains a list of groups so that this can be inspected and
	when the socket is closed we will call mcastdrop for each item.
	
	* generic/udp_tcl.h: Fixed the -ttl option for Windows.
	* generic/udp_tcl.c: Added support for setting and retrieving the
	TTL option on the socket. The default is specified by the system
	but can be set for individual sockets.

	in udpClose provided in patch #820255.

	* generic/udp_tcl.c: Applied fix from bug #833700 to close a

	* Makefile.in: Fixed to build in directories other than the top
	of the source tree.

	* generic/udp_tcl.c: Applied the patch from bug #810572 which
	fixes a memory leak in udp_open - from D. Richard Hipp?

	* generic/udp_tcl.c: General layout rearrangement to put tcl
	command procs, channel handler procs and utility procs together.
	* generic/udp_tcl.c: Added channel option handlers to enable the
	use of 'fconfigure' to hopefully replace udp_conf.
	* generic/udp_tcl.c (udpGetHandle): Fixed to return the handle
	properly.

2003-03-03  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* genetic/udp_tcl.c: Enhanced udp_open and udp_conf to permit the
	use of symbolic port names. Added some tests for this.
