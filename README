TclUDP
======

This package provides UDP sockets for Tcl.

INSTALLATION
============

This package uses the Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA). Please see the
web page

    http://www.tcl.tk/doc/tea/

for more information about TEA.

UNIX BUILD
==========

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script
and then run make. For more information about the build process, see
the tcl/unix/README file in the Tcl src dist. The following minimal
example will install the extension in the /opt/tcl directory.

	$ cd tcludp
	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tcl
	$ make
	$ make install

WINDOWS BUILD
=============

See the tcl/win/README file included in the Tcl src dist for details
about how to build the extension under Windows. We suggest using
the Msys + Mingw build process since it is significantly easier
than building with VC++ or Cygwin.

This package includes a Visual Studio project file to help in building
with VC++.

The package has been built using both VC++6 and Msys + Mingw. 

Microsoft Platform SDK 2003 is required for building. The following minimal
example will install the extension in the C:\Tcl\lib directory.

	$ cd tcludp/win
	$ nmake -f makefile.vc realclean all 
	$ nmake -f makefile.vc install INSTALLDIR=C:\Tcl\lib
